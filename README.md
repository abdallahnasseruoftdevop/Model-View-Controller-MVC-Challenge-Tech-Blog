This app utilizes many different files, database storage, and technologies to create a Tech blog. A user can view any blogs on the main page and click them to see the comments. Both the post and comments will show who posted them. 

If a user would like to create their own blog they can sign up to create an account or login to an existing one. Once logged in they now have access to a dashboard for posting blogs. They can also go to other blogs and comment on them leaving their name and a date.
